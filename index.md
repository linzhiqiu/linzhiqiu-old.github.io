I am Zhiqiu Lin (林之秋) from Beijing, China.

I am joining CMU Robotics Institute this fall as a Ph.D. candidate.

As a researcher in computer science, I work primarily in the intersection of **computer vision** and **machine learning**. I have been exploring a variety of topics through my past research projects, such as vision, imaging, learning in resouce-limited settings, and human computer interaction.

During my undergrad at Cornell University, I worked closely with Prof. [Noah Snavely](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~snavely/), [Bharath Hariharan](http://home.bharathh.info), and [Abe Davis](http://abedavis.com). I learned a great deal from those awesome advisors.
