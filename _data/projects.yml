    Most recognition systems nowadays live in a **closed world**. 
    Such a naive assumption is however not what the reality is. 
    In most practical scenarios, the recognition system must be able to confront an **open world** with concepts it has not yet encountered. 
    In this paper, we formalize such a problem setup by proposing a system that **actively** combats the **open** nature of the world through interaction with an oracle, while leveraging and unifying techniques in the fields of open world, few-shot, and active learning.

    How can we tell whether an image has been mirrored? 
    While we understand the geometry of mirror reflections very well, less has been said about how it affects distributions of imagery at scale, 
    despite widespread use for data augmentation in computer vision. 
    In this paper, we investigate how the statistics of visual data are changed by reflection. 
    We refer to these changes as **visual chirality**, after the concept of geometric chirality "â€”" the notion of objects that are distinct from their mirror image. 
    Our analysis of visual chirality reveals surprising results, including low-level chiral signals pervading imagery stemming
    from image processing in cameras, to the ability to discover visual chirality in images of people and faces. 
    Our work has implications for data augmentation, self-supervised learning, and image forensics.

    Low-precision training reduces computational cost and produces efficient models. Recent research in developing new low-precision training algorithms often relies on simulation to empirically evaluate the statistical effects of quantization while avoiding the substantial overhead of building specific hardware. To support this empirical research, we introduce QPyTorch, a low-precision arithmetic simulation framework. Built natively in PyTorch, QPyTorch provides a convenient interface that minimizes the efforts needed to reliably convert existing codes to study low-precision training. QPyTorch is general, and supports a variety of combinations of precisions, number formats, and rounding options. Additionally, it leverages an efficient fused-kernel approach to reduce simulator overhead, which enables simulation of large-scale, realistic problems.

    Phishing attacks are a major problem, as evidenced by the DNC hackings during the 2016 US presidential election, in which staff were tricked into sharing passwords by fake Goo- gle security emails, granting access to confidential informa- tion. Vulnerabilities such as these are due in part to insufficient and tiresome user training in cybersecurity. Ideally, we would have more engaging training methods that teach cybersecu- rity in an active and entertaining way. To address this need, we introduce the game What.Hack, which not only teaches phish- ing concepts but also simulates actual phishing attacks in a role-playing game to encourage the player to practice defend- ing themselves. Our user study shows that our game design is more engaging and effective in improving performance than a standard form of training and a competing training game design (which does not simulate phishing attempts through role-playing).
