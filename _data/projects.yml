    Most recognition systems nowadays live in a **closed world**. 
    Such a naive assumption is however not what the reality is. 
    In most practical scenarios, the recognition system must be able to confront an **open world** with concepts it has not yet encountered. 
    In this paper, we formalize such a problem setup by proposing a system that **actively** combats the **open** nature of the world through interaction with an oracle, while leveraging and unifying techniques in the fields of open world, few-shot, and active learning.

    How can we tell whether an image has been mirrored? 
    While we understand the geometry of mirror reflections very well, less has been said about how it affects distributions of imagery at scale, 
    despite widespread use for data augmentation in computer vision. 
    In this paper, we investigate how the statistics of visual data are changed by reflection. 
    We refer to these changes as **visual chirality**, after the concept of geometric chirality "â€”" the notion of objects that are distinct from their mirror image. 
    Our analysis of visual chirality reveals surprising results, including low-level chiral signals pervading imagery stemming
    from image processing in cameras, to the ability to discover visual chirality in images of people and faces. 
    Our work has implications for data augmentation, self-supervised learning, and image forensics.
